# Changelog

## Version v0.1.2

* Added `self` to exposed variables in tasks. This can be used
  to achieve what you would use $@ or other automatic variables
  in Makefiles.

## Version v0.1.1

First actual release. While the tool is not feature complete by any means,
it does *some* stuff and what it does it seems to do well.

For details on what it can and can't do, see the
[README.](https://github.com/ralsina/hace/blob/main/README.md)
